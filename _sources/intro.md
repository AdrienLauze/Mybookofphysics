    <p>I have been passionate about mathematics and physics since I was very young. In terms of physics, I am extremely interested in neutron diffraction, cosmology, and the philosophy of science. The mathematical fields that are most important to me are analysis, linear algebra, and propositional calculus in logic. I greatly enjoy programming in Python and C.

Have a nice visit!
